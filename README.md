The following project is an assignment for programming. 

I was tasked with building a chatbot that will help users with issues pertainting to cybersecurity. ifyou hav questions about things not cyber related the chatbot wont be able to grant you an answer 
when you launch the cahtbot, a voice recording should play followed by an ascii lgo of my chatbot. then after the program executes those thats when you can start interacting with the chatbot. 
The bot is in the launguage C#.
Please input your name before going forward as you wont be able to proceeed with the program if you dont put your name there. 
when you want to leave the program you just type "exit" and the program will kick you out. 
The program only answers questions about passwords,phishing,malware and how to keep safe online.
